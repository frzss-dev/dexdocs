# Controlling FRZW supply

## Does FRZW have a hard cap?

Yes, FRZW now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.FRZDEX.finance/](https://v2litepaper.FRZDEX.finance/)

## How FRZW supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into FRZDEX's products. The goal is for more FRZW to leave circulation than the amount of FRZW that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of FRZW made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://FRZDEX.finance/voting/proposal/bafkreide2rtzqmwezritljamjswp63si4gpt2i7fo7sxf7p64sjinhhoy4), we've already effectively reduced the number of FRZW entering circulation from 40 FRZW per block to 11.16. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of FRZDEX's products (like a 20% burn of FRZW spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**FRZW Tokenomics page**](https://docs.FRZDEX.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
