# vFRZW

### What is vFRZW?

vFRZW is a number representing the boosted voting power based on a userâ€™s fixed-term FRZW staking position.

The vFRZW number will be added to your total voting power.

**Similar to iFRZW, vFRZW is NOT a new token.**

vFRZW IS NOT transferrable or tradeable.

### How is vFRZW calculated?

vFRZW is calculated based on two variables:

1. The amount of FRZW located in the Fixed-Term Staking Pool
2. The remaining lock durations of the staking positions

For point 2., it is important to clarify that the remaining lock duration is not (a) how many weeks you committed your FRZW for when you first locked it up (e.g. 52 weeks), but (b) the time remaining on your lock. In this case, if you locked FRZW for 52 weeks around 10 weeks ago, your remaining lock duration is 42 weeks, not 52 weeks.

If your remaining staking duration is less than one week, your vFRZW is equal to the amount of FRZW locked in the FRZW pool.

If your remaining staking duration is more than one week, your vFRZW is equal to the amount of FRZW locked, multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position.

For example:

* Alice locked 100 FRZW for 52 weeks; her staking position will unlock in 40 weeks. She has \`100 x 40 = 4000 vFRZW\`
* Bob locked 100 FRZW for 52 weeks; his staking position will unlock in 52 weeks. He has \`100 x 52 = 5200 vFRZW\`
* Carole locked 100 FRZW for ten weeks; and her staking position has ended. She has \`100 vFRZW\`
