# FRZW Syrup Pool

## Stake FRZW, earn FRZW!

FRZDEX now offers one FRZW Syrup Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking. Note that the Auto FRZW, IFO FRZW, and Manual FRZW pools will be retired upon the launch of the new FRZW Syrup Pool with flexible and fixed-term staking. Keep reading on to learn more!

## What‚Äôs the difference between ‚ÄúFlexible‚Äù and ‚ÄúFixed-Term‚Äù staking?

With both, you can simply stake your FRZW tokens to earn more FRZW tokens with no deposit fees. Flexible staking allows users to stake FRZW and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. Fixed-term staking allows users to maximise their yield and earn even more FRZW by locking their staked FRZW for a period of time they choose, earning a linearly boosted yield compared to flexible staking.

Flexible staking and fixed-term staking are both part of the same pool to allow users easy migration between the two staking options. However, when you do fixed-term staking, there is an option to perform flexible FRZW staking on the side.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your FRZW and forget about it! FRZW rewards will be automatically distributed and included in your staking balance, minus a small fee (same as the old Auto FRZW Syrup Pool).

**If you have FRZW staked in flexible staking**

* ‚úÖ Add more FRZW to flexible staking
* ‚úÖ Harvest rewards any time
* ‚úÖ Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)
* ‚úÖ Convert all staked FRZW in flexible to fixed-term staking
* ‚ùå Add FRZW to fixed-term staking if you have any FRZW in flexible staking
* ‚ùå Convert part of the staked FRZW in flexible to fixed-term staking

**Unstaking fee**

* **0.1%‚Ä® if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more FRZW in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest were 1 FRZW, then 0.02 FRZW would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The FRZW collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular FRZW token burns.

This is a good thing for FRZW holders because it reduces the overall amount of FRZW tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### Fixed-Term Staking

Stake your FRZW for a fixed amount of time to maximise yields and receive additional benefits! FRZW rewards will be locked along with the staked FRZW until the staking duration ends.

* No performance fees
* The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied to the yield! Always offering a higher yield compared to flexible staking!
* FRZW rewards will unlock, along with your staked FRZW, when your lock duration expires
* Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration.
* üéÅ Enjoy benefits such as:
  * üó≥Ô∏è Boosted voting power: [vFRZW](../../voting/vcake.md)
  * üöú Boosted farm yields: [bFRZW](../../yield-farming/bcake/)
  * üõçÔ∏è IFO public sale entry: [iFRZW](../../ifo-initial-farm-offering/icake.md)
  * ‚ú® Priority access or special events
  * and so much more in our ongoing multichain expansion!

**If you have FRZW locked in fixed-term staking**

* ‚úÖ Add more FRZW to lock
* ‚úÖ Extend the lock period
* ‚úÖ Perform flexible staking on the side
* ‚ùå Harvest rewards
* ‚ùå Withdraw before the lock ends
