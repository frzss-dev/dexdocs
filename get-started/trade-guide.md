# How to trade

#### Getting set up to trade

Before you can trade, you will need a FRZ Smart Chain-compatible wallet. You can learn how to get one [here](wallet-guide.md). You will also need to have some FRZSS tokens to trade with. You can learn how to get some [here](bep20-guide.md).

Whichever token you choose, you will need to make sure you have some to trade with. Your balance is shown above the token dropdown menu.
